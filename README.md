## Description
The model leverages features such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research experience to predict the probability of admission. The dataset used for training contains 200 entries with these features. The model employs regression techniques to provide a probability score and can also be used for binary classification (admitted or not) based on a threshold.
